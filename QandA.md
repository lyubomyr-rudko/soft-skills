Q. Please describe your most interesting project. Weâ€™d love to hear about your experiences, contributions, and the technologies you used.
A. My most interesting project was a web application that I developed for a client in the stock photography and digital content industry. The application was designed to help content reviewers to quickly and efficiently review and approve or reject images and videos submitted by contributors. The application was built using React.js for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB for the database. This is repalcement of the legacy application that was built using PHP. The application also utilized AWS S3 for storing and serving media files, Kinesis for message queuing and processing, and AWS Lambda for serverless functions. It uses a microservices architecture with Docker containers for deployment. The infrastructure was managed using AWS CDK and written in TypeScript.

Q. What technologies (including programming languages, frameworks, etc.) were utilized in this project?
A. The technologies used in this project included: Python, Flask with OpenAPI, React.js, Node.js, TypeScript, MongoDB, AWS S3, AWS Kinesis, AWS Lambda, Docker, AWS CDK.

Q. How many people were in the core team you worked with on this project? Please describe their roles (Frontend, Backend, QA, Design, etc.)
A. The core team consisted of 5 people: 1 Team Lead (Full Stack Developer - myself), 1 Senior Full Stack Developer, 1 Middle Full Stack Developer. The legacy app development team consist of 2 Senior Full Stack Developers, and they provided support and guidance during the transition.

Q. What was your specific role within the team? What were your responsibilities?
A. As the Team Lead, my responsibilities included: team leading, developing the frontend and backend components, managing the deployment process, mentoring junior developers, and coordinating with the client to gather requirements and provide updates on the project status.

Q. How did your team divide tasks and responsibilities?
A. We divided tasks based on the requirements and features of the application. We used an Agile methodology with sprints and user stories. Each team member was responsible for specific user stories and features, and we had daily standup meetings to discuss progress and any blockers.

Q. Did you have the opportunity to mentor anyone on your team? 
A. Yes, I mentored the less experienced developers on the team. I helped with their tasks, provided guidance on best practices, and reviewed their code to ensure quality and consistency. I also conducted code reviews and pair programming sessions to help them improve their skills. Beside this project, I also lead online teaching courses for TypeScript, and mentored coworkers on TypeScript and Redux.

Q. If you mentored others, please describe this experience.
A. During last 2 years I have been leading Typescript courses, that icluded mentorign and teaching sessions. I have also mentored junior developers on the team, helping them with their tasks, providing guidance on best practices, and reviewing their code to ensure quality and consistency. I also conducted pair programming sessions to help them improve their skills. I really enjoi mentoring and sharing my knowledge with others.


Q. Were you involved in interviewing or screening candidates for your team?
A. Yes, I was involved in interviewing and screening candidates for the team. I reviewed resumes, conducted technical interviews, and evaluated candidates based on their skills and experience. I also participated in the decision-making process to select the best candidates for the team. I have also been involved in the hiring process for other teams in the company, and have conducted technical interviews for various positions for last 10 years. 

Q. Have you served as a tech lead for any of your previous project?
A. Yes, I have served as a tech lead for several projects since 2010. I have experience leading development teams, managing projects, and coordinating with clients to deliver high-quality software solutions. I have also been responsible for defining the architecture, design, and implementation of projects, as well as mentoring junior developers and conducting code reviews.

Q.  Please specify any other development/DevOps technologies where you have expertise?
A. I have AWS Architect Associate certification, and I have experience with various AWS services such as EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, Kinesis, DynamoDB, and CloudFormation. I have hands on experience with Docker, Github Actions, Kubernetes, and Terraform. I have also worked with CI/CD pipelines, monitoring tools, and logging solutions to ensure the reliability and scalability of applications.

Q.  Describe your process for starting a new project/build. Assume that designs and requirements are already completed.
A. When starting a new project, I begin by reviewing the designs and requirements to understand the scope and objectives of the project. The communication with key stakeholders is crucial to ensure that everyone is aligned on the goals and expectations. I then create a project plan with milestones, deliverables, and timelines. I define the architecture and design of the application, including the technologies, frameworks, and tools that will be used. Then I lead estimation sessions with the team to break down the requirements into tasks and provide schedule timelines. I set up the development environment, version control system, and CI/CD pipeline. I also establish coding standards, best practices, and guidelines for the team to follow. I conduct code reviews, pair programming sessions, and regular standup meetings to track progress and address any issues. I also ensure that the project is well-documented, tested, and deployed to production in a timely manner.

Q.  What new technologies are you eager to explore in future projects?
A. I am eager to explore AI and machine learning technologies in future projects. I enjoy learning new technologies and applying them to solve real-world problems.


Q.  What aspects of a work environment are most important to you?
A. The most important aspects of a work environment for me are: a collaborative and supportive team, opportunities for growth and learning, a culture of innovation and creativity, work-life balance, and a positive and inclusive company culture. I value a workplace that encourages open communication, feedback, and continuous improvement. I also appreciate a flexible work schedule, remote work options, and a healthy work-life balance.

Q.  What factors in a job or work environment would make you hesitant or unwilling to accept an offer?
A. The main thing for me is match between my skills and the job requirements. I would be hesitant to accept an offer if the job did not align with my current skills and experience, and if there was no opportunity for growth and development. Other factors that would make me hesitant or unwilling to accept an offer include: a toxic work environment, lack of opportunities for growth and advancement. I do not work for gambling, adult content, or any other unethical business areas.
